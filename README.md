# Alt-school-assignment2
I built two web pages for showcasing courses at AltSchool Africa and presenting a personal message using various media elements.

For the first page, I created a table that lists all the schools and their respective courses at AltSchool Africa. This table includes:

School of Engineering: Frontend Engineering, Backend Engineering, Cloud Engineering, Cybersecurity.
School of Product: Product Design, Marketing, Management.
School of Data: Data Analysis, Data Science, Data Engineering.
This clear layout helps visitors quickly find information about the courses available under each school, and it’s structured simply for easy reading.

For the second page, I focused on using HTML media elements to create a compelling personal message about myself. I specifically used the <picture> element to make sure images would adjust to different screen sizes—mobile, tablet, and laptop—by providing more than three sources for responsive display. This ensures that no matter what device someone views the page on, they get a properly formatted, high-quality image.

Additionally, I included an audio element for sharing a voice message and a video element to give a more dynamic, multimedia experience. This setup creates a powerful and engaging message about who I am, leveraging the power of media to connect on a personal level.
